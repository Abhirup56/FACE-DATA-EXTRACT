# FACE DATA EXTRACTION
 This Python script utilizes MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect facial landmarks in a video. It tracks specific features (eyes, eyebrows, and lips) and calculates the distance traveled by each landmark from its initial position, outputting the results in a comma-separated format. The landmarks are visualized on the video feed with green dots.
